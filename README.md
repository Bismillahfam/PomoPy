## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pygame library

### Installing Dependencies

1. **Install Pygame** using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

Or install from requirements.txt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

1. **Clone or download** the project files
2. **Navigate** to the project directory
3. **Run** the application:

```bash
python Pomo.py
```

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

1. **Launch** the application
2. **Click "Start"** to begin a work session
3. **Work** for 25 minutes (or your custom duration)
4. **Take a break** when the timer completes
5. **Repeat** the cycle

### Timer Modes

- **Work Mode** (Red): Focused work sessions
- **Short Break** (Blue): Quick breaks between work sessions
- **Long Break** (Purple): Extended breaks after multiple pomodoros

### Interface Controls

- **Start Button**: Begin the current timer
- **Pause Button**: Pause the running timer
- **Reset Button**: Reset the current session to full duration
- **Mode Buttons**: Switch between work, short break, and long break
- **Settings Button**: Access timer settings

### Settings

1. **Click "Settings"** to open the settings dialog
2. **Adjust** the timer durations as needed:
   - Work Time (default: 25 minutes)
   - Short Break (default: 5 minutes)
   - Long Break (default: 15 minutes)
   - Pomodoros before long break (default: 4)
3. **Save** your changes

## Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

### Benefits

- **Improved Focus**: Short, timed work sessions help maintain concentration
- **Reduced Burnout**: Regular breaks prevent mental fatigue
- **Better Productivity**: Structured approach to work and rest
- **Time Awareness**: Helps track how long tasks actually take

### How It Works

1. **Choose a task** to work on
2. **Set the timer** for 25 minutes
3. **Work** on the task until the timer rings
4. **Take a short break** (5 minutes)
5. **After 4 pomodoros**, take a longer break (15-30 minutes)

## Customization

### Timer Durations

You can customize all timer durations through the settings:

- **Work Time**: 1-60 minutes (recommended: 25 minutes)
- **Short Break**: 1-15 minutes (recommended: 5 minutes)
- **Long Break**: 5-30 minutes (recommended: 15 minutes)
- **Pomodoros before Long Break**: 1-10 (recommended: 4)

### Visual Elements

The application uses a modern color scheme:

- **Background**: Dark blue-gray (#2c3e50)
- **Panels**: Lighter blue-gray (#34495e)
- **Work Mode**: Red (#e74c3c)
- **Short Break**: Blue (#3498db)
- **Long Break**: Purple (#9b59b6)
- **Buttons**: Green (#27ae60), Orange (#f39c12), Red (#e74c3c)

## Technical Details

### Dependencies

- **pygame**: Graphics and game development library
- **threading**: For non-blocking timer functionality
- **json**: For settings persistence
- **time**: For timer implementation
- **os**: For file operations

### Architecture

- **Object-oriented design** with a main `PomodoroTimer` class
- **Pygame-based graphics** for modern UI
- **Threading** for background timer execution
- **Event-driven** UI updates
- **Settings persistence** using JSON files

### Platform Support

- **macOS**: Full support with proper window handling
- **Linux**: Full support with X11/Wayland compatibility

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Pygame not found:**

```bash
pip install pygame
```

**Window doesn't appear:**

- Check if another application is blocking the window
- Try running from terminal/command prompt
- Ensure display drivers are up to date

**Timer doesn't start:**

- Ensure you're running Python 3.6+
